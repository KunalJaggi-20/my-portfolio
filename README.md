🧑‍💻 About the Project

This is my personal portfolio website crafted to resemble the VS Code environment.
It includes:

✔ Animated typing intro
✔ VSCode-style file explorer
✔ Openable tabs (about, projects, achievements, resume, socials, terminal)
✔ Animated skills chart
✔ Integrated pseudo-terminal
✔ Project README popups
✔ Dock with smooth animations
✔ Resume download button
✔ VS Code minimize → dock animation
✔ Fully responsive modern UI

I built this portfolio to represent my personality as a developer and make my projects more interactive and memorable.
